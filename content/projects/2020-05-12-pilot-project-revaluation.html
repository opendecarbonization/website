<h1>Renewable energy evaluation with energyRt</h1>
<p>The project aims to develop a generic capacity expansion model which can be (relatively) easily applied to any territory (country/region) to evaluate intermittent renewable energy potential and electric power system design with a high to 100% share of renewables. The initial “kickstarting” model will not consider any existing generating capacity, evaluating the potential of renewables, based on 40-years of hourly meteorological data from NASA’s MERRA-2 project. As the result, the project will assemble, adopt, or develop:</p>

<h1>The pilot project timeline</h1>
<p>The pilot project is a short-term project, starting now in May 2020 and is expected to conclude at the end of Summer 2020, delivering the generic kick-start model, open models for the participating countries, and the set of unified scenarios. The project will include up to 7 countries/regions.</p>

<p>The project can provide support in developing the model for up to two additional teams. Researchers/modelers who are interested in developing/applying the model for a particular country or region, please contact: <a href="mailto:opendecarbonization@gmail.com" class="email">opendecarbonization@gmail.com</a>, <a href="mailto:olugovoy@edf.org" class="email">olugovoy@edf.org</a>.</p>
