*Open Decarbonization* is an open energy modeling initiative with the purpose to develop a knowledge platform of sharable tools for reproducible decarbonization analyses, accelerate dissemination and implementation of the tools, and develop low carbon energy future scenarios available for free public use and open discussion.  
The project aims to connect modelers/researchers who has developed models and decarbonization scenarios with modelers/researchers who want to recalibrate the models for another country/region/sector, reproduce and build on the analysis, contribute low decarbonization scenarios to the public domain. Moreover, the project aims to leverage the decarbonization analyses by generating unified comparable scenarios for broader public review, discussion, and further research.
For more information on the project and how it works see *About</About>*.  
  

<span style="color:black; font-size:1.5em"> __What is on the other side of the equation </span><br><span style="color:black; font-size:1.3em">open models + open data + open scenarios = ?__    
= __minimize__{time * countries * sum(cost * model + cost * data + cost * scenarios)}  
= __maximize__{number of applications * participating countries * reproducibility * transparency * comprehension * quality of research * public knowledge * society awareness * rational decision making}  
= more scholars involved in the field  
= more research done in a shorter time   
= lower barriers to access best modeling practices  
= lower costs to solve large scale models (help from the community with access to proprietary solvers and powerful hardware)  
= crowd review of the tools and scenarios  
= faster development of models and features, their validation  
= comparison of the performance of different models   
= cross-model validation of particular scenarios  
= massive data of solved scenarios, available for comparative analysis  
= collaborative projects and publications
